# Circles Box

This application was created with the main objective of providing entertainment and at the same time serving as a valuable tool to expand knowledge about the P5.js library. Designed by me, thinking of you, have fun.

## How to use?

In the foreground, Circles Box was made to WEB uses. Therefore, has HTML, CSS and JavaScript support by default on your favorite navigator. So, if you wanna play without install dependencies or source code, you can try on [web site](<http://circlesbox.vercel.app>).

If you wanna edit the source code or play directly in localhost mode, you should clone this repository with the following git bash command line:

```git clone https://github.com/vitorluuiz/P5.js.git```

After running this command, CircleBox will be installed and finally you can acess the index.html in ./src/index.html or creating a self hosted server to provide a localhost acess to the file project, maybe you want to do this if you are a developer or wanna know how animations in P5.js seens.

Acess index.html by a double click, or after run ```cd ./CirclesBox/src``` and ```index.html``` on cmd from windows.
